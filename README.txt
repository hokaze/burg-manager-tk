Old unfinished project archived here for historical purposes.

burg-manager-tk aimed to allow for a simple graphical way to manage the configurations of BURG, the Brand-new UniveRsal bootloader from Grub, a shiny GRUB 2 alternative at the time.

A "burg-manager" program already existed, but was dependent on Linux-exclusive libraries to build the UI.
The rationale was that by using python and tkinter it would be possible to configure the bootlader easily from any major desktop: Windows, OS X, Linux or *BSD.

Due to the loss of Google Wave and general data loss when shuffling files from storage to storage over the years, dev notes and contributions by other parties have been lost.
This is all that remains.
